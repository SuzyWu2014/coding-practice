# 19. Remove Nth Node From End of list
# Given a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of list and return its head.

# For example,

#    Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

#    After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
# Note:
# Given n will always be valid.
# Try to do this in one pass.
