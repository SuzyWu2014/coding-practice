# 377. Combination Sum IV

# Given an integer array with all positive numbers and no duplicates, find the number of possible combinations that add up to a positive integer target.

# Example:

# nums = [1, 2, 3]
# target = 4

# The possible combination ways are:
# (1, 1, 1, 1)
# (1, 1, 2)
# (1, 2, 1)
# (1, 3)
# (2, 1, 1)
# (2, 2)
# (3, 1)

# Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.

# Therefore the output is 7.
