(a)
    time complexity: O(klog K) + O(nlog K)
    space: O(K)
(b) Describe two improvements to make it faster (for the cases where k>>n).
    Analyze their time complexities.

    1，Use heapify instead of trypush() to build the inital heap.
        T(n) = O(k) + O(nlog K)
        space: O(k)
    2, maintain a heap of size n
    Solution #1
        => O(n) to build a inital heap
        => O(k log n) to maintain a heap of n smallest items from ABs[i][0][0]
        => O(n log n) to get n smallest items
     time complexity T(n) = O(Klog n + n log n)
     space: O(n)
    Solution #2
        => O(K) to quickselect nth smallest element from ABs[i][0][0]
        => O(K) to pick n smallest elements from ABs[i[0][0]
        => O(n) to heapify heap of size n
        => O(n log n) to get n smallest items
      time complexity: O(k + nlog n)
      space: O(n)

2, Let V be the target value, n be the total type of coins
time complexity: T(n) = O(VM) where M = sum(V/n_i)
space: O(Vn)
