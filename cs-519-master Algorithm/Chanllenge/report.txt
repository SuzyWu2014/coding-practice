1. best()

Time complexity:
Let p[i, j] be the subproblem.
=> There are n different sizes of subproblem; size k = j - i + 1 ranging from 1 to n
=> For each size of subproblem, there are n - k alternatives
    => It takes O(k) to calculate each sub problem
    => Therefore, it takes O((n - k)*k) = O(nk) to compute each size of the subprablem.
=> Traceback: O(n), best case O(log n)

Hence, T(n) = sum(nk) for k = 1 to n
            = n * (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n)
            = O(n^3)

Space complexity:
I stored a tuple for each subproblem, there are total n^2 subproblems,
Therefore, the space complexity is O(n^2)

2. total()
Similar as above:
Time complexity T(n) = O(n^3)
Space complexity = O(n^2)

3. kbest(seq, k)
Time complexity:
Let p[i, j] be the subproblem.
=> There are n different sizes of subproblem; size t = j - i + 1 ranging from 1 to n
=> For each size of subproblem, there are n - t pairs
    => It costs O(t) to intialize a candidate heap by using heapify
    => It costs O(klog t) to get k best options from the heap
=> Therefore, it takes O((n - t)*(t + klog t)) = O(nt + nklog t) to compute each size of the subproblem.
=> O(nk) to back tracking
Hence, T(n) = sum(nt + nklog t) for t = 1 to n
            = n * (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n) + nk*(log 1 + log 2 + ...log n)
            = O(n^3 + n^2 * klog n)

Space Complexity: O(k * n^2)
=> O(n^2) number of subproblems
=> at most k best values for each subproblem
=> at most heap of size n

Therefore: O(k * n^2 + n) = O(k * n^2)
